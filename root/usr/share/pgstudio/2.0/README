PostgreSQL Studio README
========================
 
Introduction
------------
PostgreSQL Studio gives you the power to perform essential PostgreSQL 
database development tasks from a web-based console. With more and more 
PostgreSQL databases running in a Cloud environment, PostgreSQL Studio 
lets you work with your databases without the need to open firewalls.

Running
-------
This distribution bundles PostgreSQL Studio with Apache Tomcat 8.0.28. To
run PostgreSQL Studio, follow the directions to start Tomcat described in
the file, RUNNING.txt, found in this directory. If your environment is
already configured, you may be able to just run the following relative from
this directory:

  On Windows:

      THIS_DIRECTORY\bin\startup.bat

  On *nix:

      THIS_DIRECTORY/bin/startup.sh

Once Tomcat has started, you can access PostgreSQL Studio from your browser
by opening the following URL:

      http://localhost:8080 

Requirements
------------
Java 1.8 or greater
