## SESYNC Cyberinfrastructure Teaching-Lab

The National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center ([www.sesync.org](https://www.sesync.org)) offers short courses on the use of cyberinfrastructure in pursuit of the Center's scientific mission. Software for the course is bundled into a Docker image, accessible in two locations (this README serves both).

- The [source repository] on GitHub contains the Dockerfile and additional data that provide instructions for a Docker daemon to build an image.

- The [image repository] on Docker Hub contains automated builds of the teaching-lab image.

- Releases of the source on GitHub will be matched with tags on Docker Hub images, reflecting the date and name of the corresponding training event.
